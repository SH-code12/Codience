# Codience --> Sudonators Team ^_^

## Abstract
Codience is an intelligent VS Code extension that helps developers and tech leads decide what to work on next by analyzing technical complexity, business impact, dependencies, code health, risk of delay, and skill alignment.

---

## Main Idea
Codience prioritizes development tasks using AI, enabling teams to focus on the most important work first. It provides actionable, data-driven recommendations directly inside VS Code, reducing bottlenecks and improving delivery efficiency.

---

## Objectives
- Reduce bottlenecks in development workflows.
- Improve delivery speed and efficiency.
- Ensure the highest-priority work gets completed first.
- Provide data-driven recommendations directly inside the code editor.

---

## Scope
- Real-time task ranking based on multiple weighted factors.
- Seamless integration with Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and other project management/version control tools.
- Live in-editor dashboard with priority insights.
- Continuous analytics to refine prioritization accuracy over time.

---

## Key Highlights
- AI-powered prioritization of development tasks.
- Seamless integration with Jira, GitHub, and GitLab.
- Real-time task ranking based on business impact, complexity, and risk.
- Live dashboard inside VS Code for instant recommendations.
- Data-driven decision making to improve delivery speed.
- Continuous learning from past project patterns to improve accuracy.

## Expected Outcomes and Deliverables

### Expected Outcomes
- Improved developer productivity by reducing time spent deciding what to work on.
- Faster delivery cycles with fewer bottlenecks.
- Better task alignment with business priorities and team skills.
- Higher code quality by prioritizing risky or untested code for review.
- Increased visibility of project health inside the code editor.
- Data-driven decisions replacing guesswork in task prioritization.

### Deliverables

- Integration modules for Jira, GitHub, GitLab APIs.
- Real-time prioritization engine with ranking algorithms.
- Dashboard UI inside VS Code showing ranked tasks.
- Analytics and reporting module (task completion rates, code risk stats).
- Technical documentation (architecture, API references, setup guides).
- User guide for developers and tech leads.
- Demo video showing how Codience works.
- Test cases & QA reports proving stability and accuracy.
